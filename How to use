Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source Linux command-line tool that is used to scan IP addresses and ports in a network and to detect installed applications.

Nmap allows network admins to find which devices are running on their network, discover open ports and services, and detect vulnerabilities.

To scan a host: nmap www.hostname.com
To scan a range of IP addresses (.1 â€“ .10): nmap 192.168.0.1/13
